![Alt text](img/album.jpg?raw=true "Title")

**Introduction:**

We are living in an age of technology where everything is going online. From the beginning of the idea of cloud computing, everything is moving towards online and cloud storage based. This is why most of us today prefer cloud storage as a permanent backup device rather than having our own hard drives. Cloud storage involves at least one data server that a user connects to via the internet. The user sends files manually or in an automated fashion over the Internet. The stored data is then accessible through a web-based interface.
           The idea of cloud computing is used in this project by letting the users share and stream music over the cloud simultaneously with more additional features. This ensures both reliability and mobility on the go.

**Background and product context**
	The idea of this project was found from Spotify, a music streaming website where a user can listen to music. One of the main focus of this project was not only to stream/listen to our favorite songs but also to share/upload our own songs on the website.

**Project Description:**
    The name of our project is “wave-music streaming simplified”  which is a music streaming website. This website has designed into some parts like:

    (a)Registration-Login: Designing a content-centered website is much easier than designing a website where we have to deal with registered users. The target of this website that enables user accounts is just not only to highlight our featured items and services but also to inspire visitors to become a registered user. By this user registration button, we want to grab every visitor who wants to browse through our website. 

    (b)Home page: On the homepage of our website, it shows the list of all songs on the website which are stored in the cloud.
       
    (c)Music player: at the corner of the homepage, there is a ‘Music player’ button to create or manage the music player adjacent with all the details of every song(like-singer, rating) and it will show the name of the upcoming song of the song list. There are two additional buttons in the song list, one button will specify the rating of a song and another one with ‘+’icon  will help to save the playlist. If anybody chooses that icon he/she will refer to create a new playlist or choose a playlist that has been already created.
            
    (d)Add to Playlist: There is another button ‘Add to playlist’.By selecting this option we will be able to add a song into one or more playlist(the same song could be added into the different playlist) but the redundancy method will be applied here.
          
    (e) Manage Playlist: This option is given to managing the playlist by the user. Using these buttons a user will be able to add or delete playlist where a user will be able to delete the whole playlist or one by one song from the playlist by selecting the icon given beside the song names. 
        
    (f) Uploader: In this section of the website, a user will be able to upload a song with the song name, Artist’s name, and the poster given by the URL by taking input into the database. This option is given to the user to upload their favorite song if there is any shortage in the website.

    (g)Select List: By selecting this option user will be able to load a page that they want to load into the homepage with all the songs of his list and will be able to connect one list with the another and for that page will be reloaded.


**Methodology:**
**HTML:** Basic HTML is used for the page development of this website. 
**CSS:** CSS is used for styling as well as making some of the visualizations of the website. This includes many of the layout designs, images, buttons, lists, videos, colors, texts styling. 
**PHP:** PHP is used for mainly database access and also for maintaining the accessibility services like maintenance of a logged-in session, exchanging data with the database, converting text passwords into a hash encrypted format for extra security layer, upload files, copying files into one common folder. 
**Javascript:** Javascript is used for web programming in many ways on this website. Some of them include a visual design like editing DOM elements or styling them, creating the mini player and making it a functioning floating audio player, button behaviors, etc. 
**AJAX:**Ajax is used for the song rating part of the website. This allowed us to send and receive data directly to the database without reloading the page.

**Future development**
+ Options for sharing songs both in public/private folders.
+ Add a check for a pre-existing music track on the database.
+ Adding a report option to report a track to the site admin.
+ Filtering copyright music from the public playlist into the uploader’s own list.


**Conclusion**
We have try to develop a music streaming website with some basic features.In this pandemic situation communication was a big struggle,so that, we had to work separately but we tried our best to fulfill our requirements.In future we have the plan to add some more features to it which are given above.
